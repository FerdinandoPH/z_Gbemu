# Project archived (incomplete)

After working on this project for a month, I've decided to archive it. I realized that Python is waaay slower than I thought, and that my emulator was running 100x slower than a real Game Boy.

While there are things I could try to improve this situation (like using Cython), I've decided to port my progress into C, since, due to personal circumstances, I need to improve my C capabilities.

To anyone trying to make a Game Boy emulator who stumbles onto this project, I recommend you to either choose another language or start using Cython from the very beginning.

That's all, folks!

It's still a baby, and I don't know if I'll be able to finish it, but I've always been fascinated with emulation and it seems like a fun summer project.

I'm using the [PanDocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/) and the things I learned about computers at EOC in university as reference
